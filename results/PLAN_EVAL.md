Critical:  (30 × 1.0 + 0 × 0.5) / 30 × 100 = 100.0%  (30.0 of 30 critical requirements)
Important: (62 × 1.0 + 5 × 0.5) / 67 × 100 = 96.3%  (64.5 of 67 important requirements)
Detail:    (2 × 1.0 + 0 × 0.5) / 2 × 100 = 100.0%  (2.0 of 2 detail requirements)
Overall:   (94 × 1.0 + 5 × 0.5) / 99 × 100 = 97.5%  (96.5 of 99 total requirements)

### 4. Top Gaps

- PRD-091 | `important` | Validate discovery with rubric and hard-fail integrity — Manual sampling leaves discovery quality and real-show integrity vulnerable to silent regressions, which would show up as AI outputs feeling off-brand or failing to resolve cleanly in the UI.
- PRD-084 | `important` | Deliver surprising but defensible taste-aligned recommendations — Without a sharper acceptance contract, the discovery engine could drift toward safe-but-generic picks and miss the product’s core promise of taste-aware surprise.
- PRD-066 | `important` | Answer directly with confident, spoiler-safe recommendations — If Ask does not commit to an immediate answer shape, users may get pleasant but meandering responses before they get actionable guidance.
- PRD-078 | `important` | Require concept selection and guide ingredient picking — Users can technically complete Explore Similar and Alchemy, but the missing guidance risks lower completion and weaker concept choices because the interaction is less self-explanatory.
- PRD-028 | `important` | Use timestamps for sorting, sync, freshness — Timestamp fields exist, but without explicit sorting behaviors the app can feel inconsistent about what counts as “recent” and why two views order the same library differently.

### 5. Coverage Narrative

#### Overall Posture
This is a strong implementation plan. It is architecturally concrete, execution-ordered, and unusually complete against the benchmark rider and the main product surfaces. The remaining weaknesses are not structural omissions; they are mostly places where the plan stops one layer short of turning product intent into crisp acceptance criteria.

#### Strength Clusters
The plan is strongest in Benchmark Runtime & Isolation, Collection Data & Persistence, Show Detail & Relationship UX, and Settings & Export. Those areas have explicit schemas, route boundaries, state lifecycles, destructive-test strategy, and phased delivery slices that make the rider and the core collection behaviors implementable without guessing.

#### Weakness Clusters
The partial items cluster around AI behavioral contracts rather than platform architecture. Ask, Concepts, Explore Similar, Alchemy, and discovery quality all have the right modules and flows, but a few of the product’s sharpest qualitative requirements are described as intent, sampling, or validation helpers instead of being locked down as hard requirements.

#### Risk Assessment
If the team executed this plan exactly as written, the first thing a stakeholder or QA reviewer would notice is not missing pages or broken persistence. They would notice uneven AI behavior: Ask may answer too indirectly, recommendation quality may become merely competent instead of delightfully taste-aware, and discovery regressions may slip through because the rubric is sampled rather than enforced.

#### Remediation Guidance
The plan mostly needs tighter specification, not more architecture. The remaining work is to convert AI quality goals and a few nuanced UX rules into explicit acceptance criteria: where timestamps drive ordering, what Ask must do in its opening lines, what guidance the concept pickers must display, and what automated or blocking checks protect discovery quality before release.
